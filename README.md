Hi, I’m Hector Jasso

I’m interested in frontend development but no rush because I'm currently working as Fullstack developer at Neitek. However I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to Health, Industry, Point of sale and/or any field that can bring up a challenge. 

Fun fact: I was told to create my github account to show others what I'm capable of but the truth is I enjoy my job and never had to prove anything in life because I were too busy providing my services and making results come true, besides I cannot get rid of my new bank loan and I need to keep working as slave for capitalism lol but I'd love to spare time to develop a library based on SVG+JS supporting typescript to create spatial and industrial animations and some day I will make that come true as well.
