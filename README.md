- 👋 Hi, I’m Hector Jasso
- 👀 I’m interested in frontend development but no rush because I'm currently working as Fullstack developer at Neitek
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Spring-boot.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to Health, Industry, Point of sale and/or any field which can bring up a challenge. 

- ⚡ Fun fact: I was told to create my github account to show others what I'm capable of but the truth is I enjoy my job and never had to prove anything in life because I were too busy providing my services and making results come true, besides I cannot get rid of my new bank loan and I need to keep working as slave for capitalism lol but I'd love to spare time to develop a library based on SVG+JS supporting typescript to create spatial and industrial animations and some day I will make that come true as well.
