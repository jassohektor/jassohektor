Hello, I’m a Fullstack developer!

I’m interested in frontend development but no rush because I'm currently working as Fullstack engineer at Neitek (5 years) and I have 18 years of experience. However I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to Health, Industry, Point of Sale and/or any field that can bring up a challenge to my life. 

Fun fact: I was told to create my github account to show others what I'm capable of but the truth is I enjoy my job and never had to prove anything in life because I were too busy providing my services and making results come true, besides I cannot get rid of my new bank loan and I need to keep working as slave for capitalism lol but I'd love to spare time to develop a library based on SVG+JS supporting typescript to create spatial and industrial animations and some day I will make that come true as well.
