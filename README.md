- 👋 Hi, I’m Hector Jasso
- 👀 I’m interested in frontend development but no rush because I'm currently working as Fullstack developer at Helmsbriscoe
- 🌱 I'm currently learning React but I do master Angular which I think is quite better.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to Health, Industry, Point of sale and/or any field which can bring up a challenge. 5 years having everything under control has been nice but I believe I can do more. 
- 📫 You can reach me at my email: jasso.hektor@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: Use my name!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was told to create my github account to show others what I'm capable of but the truth is I enjoy my job and never had to prove anything in life because I were too busy providing my services and making results come true, besides I cannot get rid of my new bank loan and I need to keep working as slave for capitalism lol but I'd love to spare time to develop a library based on SVG+JS supporting typescript to create spatial and industrial animations and some day I will make that come true as well.
